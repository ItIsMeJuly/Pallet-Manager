# Pallet-Manager
This application is for Bomar Sped Trans LTD. It is a simple pallet manager platform to keep track of the pallets' information such as who is the driver of the
truck, how many pallets are in the truck and how many were exchanged. Furthermore, the company where the exchange is taking place is also considered. The platform has 
two main features:
<ul>
<li>The platform with the bussines logic where the information is processed and saved.
<li>The local server that is installed in the server of the company and has MariaDB SQL database inside.
</ul>
The data in the application is always validated using various methods and has tips on the correct format of the input. This is the first version where only pallet
management is available and in the future some new features will be integrated as this will be an active platform.
